# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree

This project predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using a **Decision Tree Classifier** and health-related medical data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading health concerns worldwide.  
This machine learning project helps in early prediction by analyzing patient features such as:

- Age  
- Cholesterol  
- Blood Pressure  
- Heart Rate  
- Other medical indicators  

---

## 🚀 Workflow Steps
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training using Decision Tree  
✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)  
✅ Prediction on new patient data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Files
- `Heart Disease Prediction Decision Tree.ipynb` → Complete notebook workflow  
- `README.md` → Documentation  

---

## 📊 Model Output
The model predicts:

- `1` → Patient is at risk of heart disease  
- `0` → Patient is not at risk  

---

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, min_samples_split)  
- Trying ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Deploying as a web app using Streamlit
